excerpt:    "A retrospective of the 2023 conference season"
---

Year 2023 is slowly coming to a close, and conference season is over - at least for me. I have been
extremely fortunate this year to speak at 7 different conferences. Speaking somehow has a
"glamorous" image in the tech community. But it's "just" another social endeavour, with unspoken
rules and social norms, that you figure out the more as you do it.


## Acceptance rate: 42%

I applied to speak at 19 conferences. I got accepted 8 times (42% acceptance rate), rejected 11
times (58%). Unfortunately, I could not attend one of those, so I only spoke at 7 conferences.

I submitted 6 different talks to various conferences, of which 4 were accepted (66%). All of those
were tech-centric talks with a live demo. As a rule of thumb, if the technology is too specific, or
not widely adopted, there's little chance the talk will get accepted - unless you have a really
"catchy" angle. So OAuth2 and Spring Security worked well, but Spring Authorization Server seemed to
be too niche.

In terms of all talks submitted across all conferences, I put in 58 submissions and only 8 got
accepted, success rate is actually pretty low (~14%).

Those conferences took place in 6 different countries. I travelled by train only, and made an
exception for my employer's conference, SpringOne @ VMware Explore, which happened to take place in
Las Vegas.


## How to get accepted

It's normal to get rejected. It's much more frequent than to get accepted! There's a little bit of
spray-and-pray in submitting to "Call-For-Papers" (cfp) - submit to many things, only get accepted
to a few. You can't just target one conference: only 5 to 25% of entries make it through, depending
on the conference. I love this
[blog post](https://medium.com/@dormaindrewitz/how-to-write-an-abstract-for-your-conference-talk-or-webinar-66ae959be2e6)
by former Pivotal colleague Dormain Drewitz, where she says:

> **Why your talk wasn't selected (spoiler alert: it probably wasn't your abstract)**
>
> In the end, if your talk wasn't selected, there are many other factors that were in play.


With the improved systems we have to discover and submit to conferences, organizers are now getting
flooded with submissions. Please be gentle to them and don't submit off-topic though - submitting
your Kubernetes talk to a JavaScript conference will not get accepted. Take the time too look at the
talks from the previous editions: if there's something similar to what you were thinking about,
it's unlikely the program committee well let you though.


## Formats

I gave a few "conference talk" presentations (40~50 minutes), a short format (25 minutes), one "deep
dive" (2 hours) and a 4-hour pre-conference workshop. I also had the chance to deliver an
[ignite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)) session, 5 minutes, 20 slides,
auto-forwarding, that got scheduled at a conference I was speaking at outside of the general CFP
process.

For stuff I do, I find the deep-dive format to be the most comfortable. You have ample time so you
don't have to compress content too much, there's room for interaction with the audience, and you
don't have to get the timing perfectly right.
The 45-minute format is fine, long enough that you can elaborate, but short enough that preparation
time doesn't swallow weeks and weeks of your precious time.

Workshops are, unsurprisingly, an absolute time-sink in preparation, but they probably bring the
most value to attendees, and you get the most interactions in this format.

The ignite one was, counter intuitively, really tough to finish. I thought I'd recycle a talk and
it'd take me 30 minutes to one hour, but it took me over 4 hours to distill the message to the very
bare minimum. As [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) famously wrote:

> Je n'ai fait cette lettre-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus
> courte.
>
> _The present letter is a very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter._


## Acknowledgement

All of this was only made possible because of the amazing support I got from my employer, VMware -
they covered the expenses, travel and accommodation, and let me do this as part of my job. I'm not
in a DevRel role, just close to the open source side of the business.

Some conferences have budget for speakers who do not have the luxury of having things paid for by
their employers. Although I understand the financial constraints conferences have, it's a thing that
I'd like to see more, it would probably boost the diversity of conference speakers.
