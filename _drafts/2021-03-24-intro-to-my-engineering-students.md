            in this class, what you will NOT be learning, and why."

As I may have mentioned before (or not?), I teach Computer-Science-slash-Software-Engineering classes at my "alma mater", [Mines ParisTech](), in Paris, France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. This engineering school system is a French educational idiosyncrasy[^1].

Our "average" student, bright and smart, very good at getting great scores on maths tests, is thrown for the first time into a "pick your own adventure" type of education. And they're forced to go through intro courses that they may or may not be interested in, ranging from "I'm passionate about computer stuff" to "computers hate me, and I hate them back". Courses such as basic economics, mechanical engineering or the one I teach, Computer Science-Software Engineer. I get a group of 20 students and have to teach them the basics of programming and CS. I've given that course twice, once in Java and once in Python. I'm finally getting a better idea of what I would like to tell my students before I start the class.

## What this class is about

First and foremost, why are you here?
- What this is about
- What this is NOT about
- Why
- What's going to be painful
- Course details

[^1]: For those of you that don't know the French education system, this "engineering school" comes after two years of "prep school" where you toil away doing 10 to 15 hours of math a week, same in physics. Then you take a few exams, and depending on your rank you get into these schools. They may have specialties, for example SupaÃ©ro students study aeronautics-related stuff, while others may be more "generalist schools", like Mines. In that case, you go through a bunch of management-adjacent classes, of you get through intro classes into various fields, and then you choose a major, such as logistics, innovation sociology, quantitative finance, IT management or geology (this originally being the school of Mines, after all). After three years, they'll get a Master's degree.
