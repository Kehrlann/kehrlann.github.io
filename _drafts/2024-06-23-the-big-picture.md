In software engineering, like in most human endeavors, it's all about the details. The philosophical
argument crumbles when a particular detail of the premise is wrong. The mayonnaise won't form if the
ingredients are not mixed at room temperature. The server won't accept connections if the listen
address does not match the address of the incoming request.

Devil is in the details - but before chasing the devil, one must first be sure that they actually go
anywhere at all.
