excerpt:    "I've been implementing WebAuthN to enable passkey support in web apps, here are a few
            impressions."

Passkeys have been trending in the past few years. The term was first introduced by Apple in their
2022 WWDC conference. Then we've heard of FIDO. In 2023, more and more passkeys related-talks started
popping up during various conferences. And, in early 2024, the big SaaS and cloud vendors have been
nudging users to use passkeys to login - Okta, Google, Github...

I gave my own take on a passkey talk in March 2024 at Voxxed Zürich, and then in April 2024 with
Josh Long at Devoxx France. I wanted to do something a bit different than what I had seen
previously: focus on the actual implementation in a real app, rather than going through slides and
explaining all the details.

On top of building a demo app, I've been collaborating with Rob Winch on bringing Passkey support to
Spring Security[^1].

Therefore, I have Opinion™.


## User adoption is still very low

Even at tech conferences, where the crowd is tech-curious and generally in the "early adopter"-ish
cohort, attendees did not really know what to expect about passkeys. At Devoxx France, out of
several hundred folks in the room, less than 50% had even heard of passkeys, and only 2 people
actually used passkeys.



[^1]: Rob did all the hard work. I've only provided feedback, along with the occasional design and
    API discussion.
