excerpt:    "Scaling a startup: initial energy invested by founders
            and the possible transitions when the business takes off"
---

Recently, I read about a startup "success" story - in this case, like most startups, success means surviving long enough to bootstrap or raise capital. In the blog post that was published recounting the first few months, the inevitable hustle was mentionned - founders getting up at 4 in the morning to prepare orders for the day, doing everything themselves from business development to delivery. It vaguely reminded me of Paul Graham's essay on ["Things that don't scale"](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html). In a nutshell, the essay posits that it's justified to do things that are not sustainable or don't scale, for while. It is very likely necessary to do so if founders want to reach a "critical mass" were the ideas become a bootstrapped or growth-oriented business backed by investors. It is also most likely an unfair advantage you have over bigger competitors who have too many customers to do things that don't scale.

Your goal as a startup founder, very likely, is to scale beyond the "small business" stage at some point. Even though you might not know the ins-an-outs of _how_ exactly your business will scale, there are some assumptions you can make about how some processes will evolve. Founders fueling their startup with their own unpaid labor can only last for so long. What are the options when the business takes off ?

1. Stop doing the thing entirely, or replace it with something different. In his essay, Paul Graham mentions founders sending a hand-written thank you note to every new customer. It's likely that this won't go on forever, if you have 1000 letters a day to write. Maybe founders will stop doing it entirely, or maybe they will replace it by a printed letter with a hand written "thank you", not necessarily by them.
2. Make "the thing" extremely efficient through economies of scale. Think "building a factory". When XYZ founded RxBars, they would prepare the snacks in XYZ's mom's kitchen, one by one, by hand. I do not know the full story of how they transitioned to a hundreds-of-million snack giant, but we can safely assume they invested in industrial production capabilities early when they got their first investments.
3. Automate the thing. 
4. User cheap labor (hello, gig economy !)
