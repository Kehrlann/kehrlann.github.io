excerpt:    Scaling a startup: initial energy invested by founders
            and the consequences when the business takes off

---

Thinking about snack company that "succeeded" and tell a story about the "hustle" they went through in the first few years.

How is your founder-slave-labor going to translate in terms of actual labor once the business takes off ?
1. Automate away that slave-labor
2. Make it extremely efficient through economies of scale (think: building a factory)
3. User cheap labor (hello, gig economy !)
