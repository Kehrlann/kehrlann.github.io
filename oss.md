In my spare time, I contribute to some open source projects, either tools I use or
projects I'm interested in. Here is a short list:

<h1>Contributions</h1>

<dl class="no-justify roomy-list">
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/ilearnio/module-alias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">module-alias</a></dt>
  <dd>A node library, to register aliases of directories, and use custom module paths. This avoids horrible import paths that look like <span class="inline-code">../../../../../some/very/deeply/nested/module</span>, and have something like <span class="inline-code">`@deep/module`</span> instead. I'm one of the maintainers.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/git-duet/git-duet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-duet</a></dt>
  <dd>A simple tool that tracks the identity of both people working in a pair when they make some git commits. It does so by leveraging both the git author and the git committer. I've contributed to make the experience better when trying to use "Co-authored-by", reducing the possible failures and having more helpful error messages when failing. I've also simplified testing for developers.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://projectriff.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riff</a></dt>
  <dd>Riff is for functions ! riff is an Open Source platform for building and running Functions, Applications, and Containers on Kubernetes. I've contributed to the node function invoker, and to the gateway that ingests HTTP requests. I've done some refactoring and added a few tests.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pivotal workstation setup</a></dt>
  <dd>This project automates the process of setting up a new Pivotal machine using a simple Bash script. I've fixed a few things here and there.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/pivotal/postfacto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postfacto</a></dt>
  <dd>Postfacto helps teams run great retrospectives remotely. I've helped with deployment scripts.</dd>
