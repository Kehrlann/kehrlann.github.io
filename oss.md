<h1>Contributing to open source</h1>

In my spare time, I contribute to some open source projects, either tools I use or
projects I'm interested in. It started by fixing bugs in tools or libs I used ; and
I grew attached to some of the projects. If you want some help to start contributing,
but you don't know where to start, feel free to ping me. I'd be glad to give you a 
hand. Also, you could be interested in [Hackergarten meetups](https://hackergarten.net/)
Here is a short list of my contributions:

<dl class="roomy-list">

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spring Security</a></dt>
  <dd>Spring security is the de-facto standard for securing your Spring (Boot) apps. I've contributed to <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/commits?author=Kehrlann" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide variety of topics</a>.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-authorization-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spring Authorization Server</a></dt>
  <dd>This project delivers OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server support to the Spring community, as part of the Spring Security framework. I have implemented support for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 7636 - Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenID Connect Discovery endpoint</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-authorization-server/commits?author=Kehrlann" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a variety of topics</a>.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/Kehrlann/testcontainers-dex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Testcontainers-dex</a></dt>
  <dd>I maintain a <a href="https://testcontainers.com/modules/dex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Testcontainers module</a>
  for the <a href="https://dexidp.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dex Identity Provider</a>, along with Spring Boot testing
  integration</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/ilearnio/module-alias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">module-alias</a></dt>
  <dd>A node library, to register aliases of directories, and use custom module paths. This avoids horrible import paths that look like <span class="inline-code">../../../../../some/very/deeply/nested/module</span> and have something like <span class="inline-code">`@deep/module`</span> instead. I'm one of the maintainers.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spring Security</a></dt>
  <dd>Spring Security provides security services for the Spring framework. I've contributed to SAML
  client and OAuth2 client, with various small extensions and fixes.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/git-duet/git-duet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-duet</a></dt>
  <dd>A simple tool that tracks the identity of both people working in a pair when they make some git commits. It does so by leveraging both the git author and the git committer. I've contributed to make the experience better when trying to use "Co-authored-by", reducing the possible failures and having more helpful error messages when failing. I've also simplified testing for developers.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://projectriff.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riff</a></dt>
  <dd>Riff is for functions ! riff is an Open Source platform for building and running Functions, Applications, and Containers on Kubernetes. I've contributed to the node function invoker, and to the gateway that ingests HTTP requests. I've done some refactoring and added a few tests.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/nykula/connect-typeorm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect-Typeorm</a></dt>
  <dd>A TypeORM-based session store for ExpressJS. I have provided test examples for handling database errors, and contributed documentation.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pivotal workstation setup</a></dt>
  <dd>This project automates the process of setting up a new Pivotal machine using a simple Bash script. I've fixed a few things here and there.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/pivotal/postfacto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postfacto</a></dt>
  <dd>Postfacto helps teams run great retrospectives remotely. I've helped with deployment scripts.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Counterfeiter</a></dt>
  <dd>Counterfeiter is Go mocking library, which allows you to simply generate test doubles for a given interface. I have fixed some tests.</dd>
